## sales_data_analysis
The project workflow began with data cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy. Next, we created a BaseMeasures table featuring two key metrics: Revenue and Sales Quantity. Using these metrics, we developed visualizations to provide valuable insights, including:

Revenue by Market
1. Sales Volume by Market
2. Top 5 Customers by Purchase Volume
3. Top 5 Products by Sales Volume
4. Revenue Trend Over Time
Additionally, filters by Year and Month allow for a focused analysis of specific periods, enabling more targeted insights. This approach provides a comprehensive view of revenue trends and market performance.
